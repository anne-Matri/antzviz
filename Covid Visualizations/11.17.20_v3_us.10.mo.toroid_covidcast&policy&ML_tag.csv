In regards to private labs, the DOH uses them to increase testing capacity:   "Florida recently partnered with private laboratories around the state to expand COVID-19 laboratory testing capacity. This partnership will increase the number of tests conducted each day and ensure Floridians receive the critical health information they need in a timely manner.

On Monday, Ducey will ease some restrictions to allow certain stores previously deemed non-essential to begin offering delivery, window, walk-up, drive-thru, curbside or appointment-based service. Retailers can begin offering in-store sales if they have the proper safety protocols in place, such as reducing occupancy, enforcing physical distancing requirements and expanding sanitation measures. Restaurants, bars, gyms and theaters are not eligible to participate in the first phases of the reopening, according to the governor, but may start to operate as early as May 11.    https://web.archive.org/web/20200716071205/https://azgovernor.gov/file/34712/download?token=aWa7Jw6L  https://web.archive.org/web/20200802152404/https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/04/29/arizona-gov-doug-ducey-gives-update-stay-at-home-order-coronavirus-covid-19/3032731001/  https://web.archive.org/web/20200802152337/https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts/2020/05/04/gov-doug-ducey-reopening-businesses-trump-arrives-coincidence/3082620001/",""

Less than two days after New York relaxed certain coronavirus restrictions on religious services and Memorial Day events, allowing gatherings of up to 10 people, the state has extended the measure to cover all gatherings for "any lawful purpose or reason." Gov. Andrew Cuomo amended the move in an executive order Friday.    The modification comes with the caveat that residents adhere to "social distancing protocols and cleaning and disinfection protocols" required by state health officials.  https://web.archive.org/web/20200626114253/https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/EO_202.32.pdf",""

ASU will launch several testing sites that will provide free saliva diagnostic testing for COVID-19 in high-need underserved communities around the state. The testing will begin this Saturday, July 11 in the West Valley. The tests are by appointment only, which can be scheduled by visiting azhealth.gov/testing.    However, while generally available, saliva tests are likely not as reliable as nasal swaps, but since the test method remains a PCR test (just on a different specimen), coded as 3.    https://www.azdhs.gov/director/public-information-office/index.php#news-release-070920 (not archivable due to website structure)",""

Previously, the order had been extended through July 7th, but now it seems the order will be in effect through September 5th.

22863,22996,0,"C1 School closing: 13 July, 2020:   "Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced new, data-driven guidance for reopening schools in New York State. Schools in a region can reopen if that region is in Phase IV of reopening and if its daily infection rate remains below 5 percent or lower using a 14-day average since unPAUSE was lifted. Schools will close if the regional infection rate rises above 9 percent, using a 7-day average, after August 1. New York State will make the formula determination during the week of August 1 to 7."    As of July 13th, New York City is in Phase 3. Other regions are in Phase 4.      "New York State, the Reimagine Education Advisory Council and the Department of Health released finalized guidance and guiding principles for reopening schools today... The DOH and Governor's Reimagine Council are working closely with the Department of Education as it releases education guidance. Plans to reopen schools are due on July 31."      OxCGRT's coding policy is to retain the code going into the summer holidays until schools officially start reopen, even if the State's guidance has relaxed. Hence, the code will remain 3G.

"On August 6, in close coordination with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Department of State lifted the Global Level 4 Health Advisory.  The Global Advisory, initially put in place on March 19, 2020, advised U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19.    With health and safety conditions improving in some countries and potentially deteriorating in others, the Department is returning to our previous system of country-specific levels of travel advice (with Levels from 1-4 depending on country-specific conditions), in order to give travelers detailed and actionable information to make informed travel decisions.  This will also provide U.S. citizens more detailed information about the current status in each country.  We continue to recommend U.S. citizens exercise caution when traveling abroad due to the unpredictable nature of the pandemic."    https://web.archive.org/web/20200806204550/https://www.state.gov/lifting-of-global-level-4-global-health-advisory/",""

"On August 6, in close coordination with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Department of State lifted the Global Level 4 Health Advisory.  The Global Advisory, initially put in place on March 19, 2020, advised U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19.    With health and safety conditions improving in some countries and potentially deteriorating in others, the Department is returning to our previous system of country-specific levels of travel advice (with Levels from 1-4 depending on country-specific conditions), in order to give travelers detailed and actionable information to make informed travel decisions.  This will also provide U.S. citizens more detailed information about the current status in each country.  We continue to recommend U.S. citizens exercise caution when traveling abroad due to the unpredictable nature of the pandemic."    https://web.archive.org/web/20200806204550/https://www.state.gov/lifting-of-global-level-4-global-health-advisory/",""

"On August 6, in close coordination with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Department of State lifted the Global Level 4 Health Advisory.  The Global Advisory, initially put in place on March 19, 2020, advised U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19.    With health and safety conditions improving in some countries and potentially deteriorating in others, the Department is returning to our previous system of country-specific levels of travel advice (with Levels from 1-4 depending on country-specific conditions), in order to give travelers detailed and actionable information to make informed travel decisions.  This will also provide U.S. citizens more detailed information about the current status in each country.  We continue to recommend U.S. citizens exercise caution when traveling abroad due to the unpredictable nature of the pandemic."    https://web.archive.org/web/20200806204550/https://www.state.gov/lifting-of-global-level-4-global-health-advisory/",""

26655,26809,0,"C1 School closing: August 7, 2020: "Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that based on each region's infection rate, schools across the state are permitted to open this fall. Every region's infection rate is below the threshold necessary by the State's standards to open schools. The Department of Health will review submitted reopening plans from school districts and notify districts of their status on Monday [OXCGRT Coder, Cassy Inman's insert: "Monday, August 10"]. Out of 749 school districts across the state, 127 have not yet submitted plans to the Department of Health, and another 50 are incomplete or deficient.  The determination of how individual districts reopen - in-person vs a hybrid model - will be made by local school districts under strict Department of Health guidelines. The Department of Health's guidance is available here.  The Governor also announced that school districts must post their remote learning plan online as well as their plan for testing and tracing students and teachers. Schools must also have three to five public meetings prior to August 21 with parents - who will be allowed to participate remotely - as well as one meeting with teachers to go through their reopening plan." Coding remains at 3G since all school districts remain closed for the summer holidays.

This includes closing schools in Red and Orange Zones.See below, the NYC Department of Education’s School Closures webpage, which gives a detailed list of every school closed for at least two weeks from 8th October. This means that this indicator rises to 2T.     The university situation in New York is not at the level of total shut-down – on 7th October, SUNY Chancellor Malatras and Binghamton University President Stenger announced a “precautionary pause” on all-in person classes and activities as a result of the surge in cases in Broome County. However, as neither university has reached the case threshold for an automatic shut-down and transition to remote learning, 2T seems the most appropriate indicator currently.

37207,37424,0,"C7_Restrictions on internal movementOn 31st October, Governor Cuomo announced new guidelines allowing out-of-state travelers to New York to ‘test out’ of the mandatory 14-day quarantine. The policy comes into effect on 4th November.     Travelers must receive a negative test result within three days of their departure from their state of origin, and must then quarantine for three days upon arrival in New York. On the fourth day they must take a test – if both tests come back negative, they are free to come out of quarantine in New York. This applies to all states that are not contiguous with New York. More details can be found in the linked source below. As the new guidelines still constitute restrictions on internal movement, 2G remains in place.
